  In 2015, when I started my adventure in the web, I was struck by the contrast between this domain and the one I had just left, embedded dev. The culture is so different, the size of the projects must surely explain it. I came from a world where we spent a lot of time writing specifications and design documents before starting to code. And I arrived in a world where many things are exchanged orally, over coffee or a short meeting. Specifications of what to do are often found in ticketing tools. Anyway, so I was surprised and I’m still, but it is okay.

Otherwise, why be interested in the subject of Oral Culture? Let’s take a few real-life situations:

• We realize that sometimes we have had to make important decisions, which we have not documented. Which makes it difficult to track who decided what, and why.  
• We attend a meeting where we discuss a new project, but we leave with more questions than answers. Information seems to get lost along the way between the different people involved, and we’re not sure what we’re supposed to do.  
• We notice that those who are more extroverted are always aware of the latest news and important decisions, while those who are more reserved or introverted seem to be left out of the loop.  
• Every week, we have so many meetings that we don’t have time to concentrate on our real work. We spend more time in meetings than in front of our computer moving projects forward.  
• We recently joined this company, but we struggle to understand the ins and outs of its projects. It seems that a lot of important information is passed on simply by word of mouth, and we feel left out because we don’t know everything.  
• We have been assigned to take over the work of a colleague who has just left, but we feel completely overwhelmed. There is no documentation of what he actually did, and we now have to spend hours trying to understand how he managed his tasks.

The desire to understand the specificities of such a culture, its advantages and drawbacks and its impact on the performance of a company, pushes me to share this with you.
