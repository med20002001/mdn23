By combining Oral and Written communication wisely, we can create a more effective work environment, where information is shared clearly, errors are reduced and collaboration is fostered.

Verbal discussions can be followed by written documentation that summarizes key points, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or forgetting.

Writing remains very important, particularly in our IT organizations. Documentation is the key to addressing issues such as:

- Capitalizing on knowledge and sharing good practices.
- Effective integration of new members and continuing training.
- Clear specification of needs to minimize errors and make dev teams autonomous in execution.
- Standardization of practices to guarantee consistency in company processes.
- Formalization of architectural decisions to explain the context, the problem to be solved, the possible options, the choice and its impacts.
